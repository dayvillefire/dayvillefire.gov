The Dayville Volunteer Fire Company was incorporated in 1939, after having been run as a one-man fire company by founder Byron F. Barrowclough. In 1959, the Dayville Fire District was formed as a special taxing district, and the Dayville Volunteer Fire Company moved from being a fundraising and governance body to a charitable organization which furthers the cause of firefighting, public safety, and the public good in and around Dayville.
