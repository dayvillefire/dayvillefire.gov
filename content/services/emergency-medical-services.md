The **Dayville Fire Company** provides an R1 (first responder) service at the EMT-B level. Transport is handled by a third party agency, which is primarily [KB Ambulance](https://kbambulance.com/), backfilled by [Mortlake Ambulance](https://www.mortlakefire.com/), [American Legion Ambulace](https://www.facebook.com/ALAFPost91/) and [Putnam EMS](https://www.facebook.com/PutnamEMS578/).

Dayville accepts both EMR (emergency medical responder) and EMT (emergency medical technician) level personnel.

In additional to EMR and EMT first responder services, Dayville's EMS company also staffs the [Killingly Rehabilitation Unit](/services/rehabilitation) and provides [no-to-low cost training](/services/training/) for CPR and EMS certifications and continuing education units.
